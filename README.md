  ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/bikashparamanik/PRODIGY_ML_03.git
   cd dog-vs-cat-classifier
## Usage
To classify an image, use the following command:
python classify_image.py path_to_image.jpg
Replace path_to_image.jpg with the path to the image you want to classify.
## Features
High Accuracy: Our model achieves impressive accuracy in distinguishing between dog and cat images.
User-Friendly: We provide an easy-to-use command-line interface, making it accessible for both novice and advanced users.
Customizable: Advanced users can fine-tune SVM hyperparameters to experiment with different classification settings.
## Dataset
Our model is trained on a dataset consisting of 25,000 labeled dog and cat images. The dataset was collected from kaggle. It serves as a comprehensive foundation for training and evaluating the model's performance.
## Training
Interested in understanding the training process or eager to train the classifier with your own dataset? Our Training Notebook provides detailed insights, step-by-step instructions, and code samples to guide you through the training journey.
